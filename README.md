# Geodetic Computing with MATLAB

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of MATLAB scripts and functions designed for Geodetic Engineering applications. It covers essential coordinate transformations, fundamental geodetic problems, and academic assignments.

## Key Features
* **Coordinate Transformations:** 2D/3D Helmert, Affine, and Similarity transformations.
* **Geodetic Calculations:** Direct and inverse geodetic problems on the ellipsoid.
* **Datum Conversion:** Conversions between Cartesian (X, Y, Z) and Curvilinear (φ, λ, h) coordinates.
* **Fundamental Assignments:** Solutions for standard geodetic coursework including network adjustments and surveying calculations.

## Repository Structure
* **`Transformations/`:** Scripts for various datum and coordinate system shifts.
* **`Basics/`:** Fundamental geodetic tasks and homework solutions.
* **`Projections/`:** Algorithms for Map Projections (UTM, Gauss-Krüger, etc.).
* **`Utilities/`:** General helper functions for matrix operations and unit conversions (DMS to Decimal, etc.).

## Prerequisites
* MATLAB R2021a or newer.
* No additional toolboxes are required as the scripts rely on core MATLAB functions for maximum compatibility.

## Scientific Significance
These algorithms are implemented with a focus on high-precision numerical computing. The matrix-based approach of MATLAB ensures efficiency and accuracy in solving large-scale geodetic networks and complex non-linear models.
